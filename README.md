============

## maplibre-gl-measures
A Maplibre plugin for taking length measures with lines and area measures with polygons.

It's working with [Maplibre](http://maplibre.org) inspired by the great work done by [mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw)

## Demo

(still working on a proper demo) <s>You can rush to the [demo here.](https://jdsantos.github.io/maplibre-gl-measures/)</s>


## Getting started

To use this plugin you need to run:

``` js
npm install --save maplibre-gl-measures
```

and then, in your code use it as follows:

``` js

// Import it into your code
import MeasuresControl from 'maplibre-gl-measures';


```
### Supported Versions

Maplibre 2.4  and later versions should be supported. Earlier versions probably won\'t work (not even tested anymore).
